## 🚀 The Complete Journey

We're building [BeingCiteable](https://beingciteable.com) completely in public - from first line of code to dogfooding success.

**The Mission:** Help brands track and optimize their visibility or we call it **Citability Score** in AI platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity and more.

**The Challenge:** Build it transparently, launch it publicly, then prove it works by making ourselves citeable.

## Weekly Time Allocation
Weekday Evenings (Monday-Friday):
- 8:00-10:00 PM: 2 hours/night × 5 nights = 10 hours
- Realistic: Account for tired days, life happens = 8 hours average

Weekend Development:
- Saturday: 3-4 hours (morning or afternoon block)  
- Sunday: 2-3 hours (lighter day for planning/docs)
- Weekend total: 5-7 hours

Total Weekly: 13-15 hours (sustainable for months)

Phase 1: Development (24 weeks = 6 months)
Phase 2: Launch (4 weeks = 1 month)  
Phase 3: Dogfooding (12 weeks = 3 months)
Total: 40 weeks = 10 months

## 📊 Current Status

**Phase:** 1 - Development  
**Week:** 1 - Foundation & Infrastructure  
**Started:** June 30, 2025  
**Current Milestone:** Tech stack decisions completed - Azure, Entra External ID, Azure SQL Serverless, GitHub Actions

### ✅ Completed Technology Decisions
- **Cloud Platform:** Azure (Microsoft ecosystem familiarity)
- **Authentication:** Microsoft Entra External ID (cost-effective, easy integration)
- **Database:** Azure SQL (MSSQL Serverless) with auto pause (speed over cost, optimized with auto pause)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (native integration with source hosting)

### 📝 Architecture Notes
- No staging/test environment initially for cost savings
- Development and production environments only until close to launch
- Focus on Microsoft stack for team familiarity and faster development
