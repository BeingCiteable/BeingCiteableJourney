## 🚀 The Complete Journey

We're building [BeingCiteable](https://beingciteable.com) completely in public - from first line of code to dogfooding success.

**The Mission:** Help brands track and optimize their visibility or we call it **Citability Score** in AI platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity and more.

**The Challenge:** Build it transparently, launch it publicly, then prove it works by making ourselves citeable.
